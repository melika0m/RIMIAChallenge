Overview
This project implements a deep learning pipeline to recognize license plate characters using transfer learning from models like ResNet50, InceptionV3, and Xception. The final prediction is generated by averaging the outputs of these models (ensemble method) to improve accuracy.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
OpenCV
Pandas
NumPy
Installing Dependencies
Install the required packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
1. Load and Preprocess Data
The dataset should be organized with images in a directory and labels in a CSV file.

data/train_data/final_train_set/: Directory containing training images.
data/train_labels.csv: CSV file mapping image filenames to license plate numbers.
data/test_data/final_test_set/: Directory containing test images.
2. Train the Model
You can train the model by running:
python train.py
This script will:

Load and preprocess the dataset.
Train three models (ResNet50, InceptionV3, and Xception) using transfer learning.
Ensemble the models to improve prediction accuracy.
3. Hyperparameter Tuning
To tune the hyperparameters, you can modify the train.py script:

Adjust learning rates, batch sizes, dropout rates, and dense layer units in the script.
The script loops through different combinations to find the best performing model configuration.
4. Ensemble Method
After training the models, their predictions are averaged (ensemble method) to generate the final output. This approach improves accuracy by leveraging the strengths of each model.

5. Generate Submission
After training, you can generate a submission file for evaluation:
python generate_submission.py
This script will:

Load the test images.
Use the trained ensemble model to predict the characters in the license plates.
Generate a CSV file in the required submission format.
